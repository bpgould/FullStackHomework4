In this homework assigment, I leveraged the capabilities of jQuery, Bootstrap, JS built in Date() function, DOM API, local storage
and many principles of OOP.

I have added the original directions for reference.

I added a css reset file for best practice.

I would like to use multiple threads in the future to add concurrent functions.

I would like to add a pause button that obfuscates the page.
