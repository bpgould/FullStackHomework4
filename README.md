# FullStackHomework4
https://bpgould.github.io/FullStackHomework4/

In this homework assigment, I leveraged the capabilities of jQuery, Bootstrap, JS built in Date() function, DOM API, local storage
and many principles of OOP.

I have added the original directions for reference.

I used https://letsfindcourse.com/technical-questions/javascript-mcq/javascript-mcq-questions for some of the questions used.

I added a css reset file for best practice.

I would like to use multiple threads in the future to add concurrent functions -- I would probably re-write the whole thing
knowing what I know now, I would use different data structures.

I would like to add a pause button that obfuscates the page.

I have added many extra features that were not required including:
the questions are randomized every game (and re-seeded),
there is a progress bar,
there is a percentage tracker,
I used objects for the question/answer data,
I used modals for the leaderboard + about pages,
and the UI is built to handle most, if not all, user errors

TODO: fix pauseTime(), sort then store score in LocalStorage
