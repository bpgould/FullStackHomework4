# FullStackHomework4
https://bpgould.github.io/FullStackHomework4/

In this homework assigment, I leveraged the capabilities of jQuery, Bootstrap, JS built in Date() function, DOM API, local storage
and many principles of OOP.

I have added the original directions for reference.

I added a css reset file for best practice.

I would like to use multiple threads in the future to add concurrent functions.

I would also like to add some try/catch since I get a weird error due to an array not finishing being populated before 
the data is used somewhere else. I think a callback function may be necessary.
